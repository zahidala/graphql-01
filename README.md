## Info 

This app is built as a part of my <b>Reboot01</b> projects. The objective was to build an app that can display progression statistics for a logged in user using data from a <b>GraphQL</b> endpoint provided by <b>Reboot01</b>.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
